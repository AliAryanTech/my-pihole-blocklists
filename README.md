# my-pihole-blocklist
This blocklist is intentioned to use with other blocklistst for adult content, such as the the well-known blocklist from Chad Mayfield.
(https://github.com/chadmayfield/my-pihole-blocklists)

It is not intended to serve as a "complete" blocklist, but to close gaps, that were discovered within my network while using said blocklist.

Also, this list will not be under active development, but rather can be seen as a centralized way to store this addition,
while making it availab for others, that might have an interest in this list.

So, for everyone interested, please feel free to simply add the raw representation to you own blocklists.
