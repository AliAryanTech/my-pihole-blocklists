# my-pihole-blocklist
This blocklist is intentioned to use with other blocklistst for adult content, such as the the well-known blocklist from Chad Mayfield.
(https://github.com/chadmayfield/my-pihole-blocklists)

It is not intended to serve as a "complete" blocklist, but to close gaps, that were discovered within my network while using said blocklist.

For everyone interested, simply add the raw representation to you own blocklists.
